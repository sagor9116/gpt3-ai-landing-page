# **GPT3 OPEN AI landing page - with REACT**

## Hello there 👋!! Thanks for cheaking out this project.

This project is built with **REACT**. Primary goal of this project is to build a static landing page with react. I hope to a basic understanding of react and how to use react efficiently in an application. I also hope the the project will help to improve and sharpen my web layout skill.

# **2. Overview 🎯**

## The challenges

This is a static landing page, with no user activity but users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## How to run the projects

This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can download the zip file from github. After downloading the zip file go to the downloaded folder and extract the folder. select the extracted folder and open your terminal.
Then run the command

### `npm install` or `npm i` to download the necessary dependencies for the project.

## In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This command will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# **4. My process ✨**

## Built With

- React
- CSS3 custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design with media query

## What I learned

- Learned how to break-down enitre application in smaller components.

- Reuse the components when needed.

- Maping through data for displaying similar objects, other than writing same code over and over again.

- Customize design component to display data according to the layout.

- Learned how to use flexbox and css grid in a better way and when to use which one.

- Got a good practice with website layout with a realistic design.

- Got a good practice with media query for responsive layout.

## Useful resources

- checkout [CSS TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) page to get a deep understanding about how flexbox work.

- You can check out [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xMQfnTU6oo&t=79s) for understanding CSS Grid.

- You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

- To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
